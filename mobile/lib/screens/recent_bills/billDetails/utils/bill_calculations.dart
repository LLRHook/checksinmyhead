///
/// A comprehensive utility class that handles all bill-related calculations for a given bill.
/// This class is responsible for generating person shares, calculating item totals,
/// determining tax and tip distributions, and providing various bill analytics.
///
/// The class implements caching for performance optimization, storing calculation results
/// to avoid redundant computations when the same data is requested multiple times.
///
/// Key responsibilities:
/// - Converting bill data into person-specific payment amounts
/// - Calculating how items, tax, and tip are distributed among participants
/// - Generating BillItem objects from serialized bill data
/// - Providing utility methods for bill analysis (equal shares, assignment verification)
///
/// All monetary values are handled as double and represent currency amounts.
