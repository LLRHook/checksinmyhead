issues to fix:

if they have something selected, but then they toggle bday, they need to be removed from that

assign to X is back, so when X is assigned to item, they can be assigned to it again. rather than the disabled button.
split with X feature, when X is assigned and Y is selected to choose items is gone. 

"Split Evenly" doesn't seem to work properly. it's not being added into their subtotal or something. we can see that the tax doesn't match up.

summary:
calcs work i think

share functionality:
when share is hit, it puts names and their total into a nice text msg format.
could say the items they got, their share of tip and tax, and then the total.
provide a way to add a payment method or something. link their zelle or venmo
who knows

done:
store the last 10 in the shared pref or something
