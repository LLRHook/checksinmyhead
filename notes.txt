issues to fix:

first page:
alcohol tax, if considering alc tip as separate. think of how to make that eloquent

share functionality:
provide a way to add a payment method or something. link their zelle or venmo

done:
store the last 3 bills in local database

- if you don't have enough items in the thing, say you have a bill of 100 and 1 item in there,
then you can press the unassigned items and it doesn't do what we expect.
- SOLUTIONS? could just enforce the fact that the total must be met or something

- dark mode? causes a plethora of issues throughout the app

- on iphone 15 pro, the custom split button is overflowing.

- the modal for when you don't fully assign, the UNASSIGNED AMOUNT dialog has a kinda ugly UI. the button is messed up too, it doesn't work nor looks good.

- address deprecated methods, and remove comments

- test application thoroughly, potentially just buying the apple license and releasing the app in beta

- allow access to contacts, derive names from there. deeplink the venmo to the phone number

- the split distribution be messing up if the % is small. doesn't show all the pieces
