issues to fix:

first page:
alcohol tax, if considering alc tip as separate. think of how to make that eloquent

summary:
calcs work i think
ask for faang/duolingo caliber redesign

share functionality:
when share is hit, it puts names and their total into a nice text msg format.
could say the items they got, their share of tip and tax, and then the total.
provide a way to add a payment method or something. link their zelle or venmo
who knows

done:
store the last 10 in the shared pref or something
