issues to fix:

first page:
need the alc tax to show in the billSummary, and then move through the rest of the app.
maybe it should attach to the alcohol item as part of the price/share or whatever.

---
share functionality:
provide a way to add a payment method or something. link their zelle or venmo.
opt for airbnb style, login with number + 2FA which will build their "account"
add venmo/zelle (can i get their current phone # from sim?)
Profile Creation

After verification, prompt for:

Name (for display in the app)
Venmo username (stored securely on backend)


Minimal information, focused just on enabling the core functionality


Contact Integration

Request contacts permission
Match contact phone numbers with registered users in your system
Show which contacts have accounts (and thus Venmo links available)


For Non-App Users

Option to send SMS invites to contacts
Include deep link to app with referral code
Can still add them to splits manually without Venmo links

- build the functionality of the recent bills view more:
- share bill, maybe clean up delete modal, and then also the bill details/pill expansion.
- cheeky lil redesign?

- if you don't have enough items in the thing, say you have a bill of 100 and 1 item in there,
then you can press the unassigned items and it doesn't do what we expect.
- SOLUTIONS? could just enforce the fact that the total must be met or something

- dark mode? causes a plethora of issues throughout the app

- on iphone 15 pro, the custom split button is overflowing.

- the modal for when you don't fully assign, the UNASSIGNED AMOUNT dialog has a kinda ugly UI. the button is messed up too, it doesn't work nor looks good.

- address deprecated methods, and remove comments

- test application thoroughly, potentially just buying the apple license and releasing the app in beta

- allow access to contacts, derive names from there. deeplink the venmo to the phone number

- the split distribution be messing up if the % is small. doesn't show all the pieces
