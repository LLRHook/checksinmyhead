# Scaling Considerations

This document explores how Billington's architecture could evolve to support growth beyond its current local-only implementation while balancing privacy concerns with scalability needs.

## Current Local-Only Architecture

Billington's privacy-first approach provides key advantages:
- Complete data privacy (no data ever leaves the device)
- Zero server costs or maintenance
- No authentication system required
- Simple architecture with minimal points of failure

However, this approach has inherent limitations:
- No cross-device synchronization
- No shared bill collaboration 
- Limited history (30 bills maximum)
- No backup/recovery mechanism

## Pragmatic Scaling Approach

A realistic scaling path would require fundamental architectural changes:

### 1. Authentication System

Adding user accounts would be necessary to support any cloud features:

```
┌──────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│                  │     │                  │     │                  │
│  Authentication  │────▶│  Authorization   │────▶│   User Profile   │
│     Service      │     │     Service      │     │     Service      │
│                  │     │                  │     │                  │
└──────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘
```

**Implementation considerations:**
- OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect for third-party authentication
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Secure password storage with proper hashing (Argon2)
- Privacy-preserving profile data (minimal collection)

### 2. Data Synchronization

To enable cross-device usage while maintaining privacy:

```dart
// Client-side encryption approach
class EncryptedBillRepository {
  // Generate encryption key from user credentials
  Future<EncryptionKey> deriveKeyFromCredentials(UserCredentials creds) async {
    // Key derivation using PBKDF2 or similar
  }
  
  // Encrypt bill data before sending to server
  Future<EncryptedData> encryptBill(Bill bill, EncryptionKey key) async {
    // Client-side encryption
  }
  
  // Decrypt bill data after retrieving from server
  Future<Bill> decryptBill(EncryptedData data, EncryptionKey key) async {
    // Client-side decryption
  }
}
```

**Technical implementation:**
- End-to-end encryption for all bill data
- Data encrypted/decrypted only on client devices
- Server stores only encrypted blobs
- Conflict resolution for concurrent modifications

### 3. Database Scaling

As user numbers grow, database architecture would need optimization:

| Scale         | Users      | Database Approach               | Cost Considerations           |
|---------------|------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Small         | <10K       | Single PostgreSQL instance     | ~$50-100/month               |
| Medium        | 10K-100K   | Primary-replica setup          | ~$200-500/month              |
| Large         | 100K-1M    | Sharded database               | ~$1K-3K/month                |
| Enterprise    | >1M        | Multi-region, sharded database | ~$5K+/month                  |

**Key scaling approaches:**
- Read replicas for scaling read operations
- Database sharding by user ID for write scaling
- Caching layer using Redis for frequently accessed data
- Time-series approach for historical bills

### 4. API Layer Architecture

A scalable API would use:

```
                 ┌─────────────┐
                 │             │
                 │  API Gateway│
                 │             │
                 └──────┬──────┘
                        │
         ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
         │              │              │
┌────────▼─────┐ ┌──────▼───────┐ ┌────▼───────────┐
│              │ │              │ │                │
│ User Service │ │ Bill Service │ │ Sharing Service│
│              │ │              │ │                │
└──────────────┘ └──────────────┘ └────────────────┘
```

**Implementation details:**
- REST API with GraphQL for flexible data querying
- Microservices architecture for independent scaling
- Rate limiting and throttling for API protection
- Stateless services for horizontal scaling

### 5. Privacy-First Features at Scale

Even with cloud functionality, privacy could remain a priority:

- **Transparency**: Clear data usage policies showing what data is stored
- **Control**: Users can delete data permanently at any time
- **Minimization**: Only store what's necessary for functionality
- **Zero-knowledge**: Server has no ability to read unencrypted data
- **Optional cloud**: Keep local-only mode as an option for privacy-conscious users

## Technical Trade-offs

Scaling would require balancing competing concerns:

| Feature | Privacy Impact | Technical Complexity | User Benefit |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Cloud sync | Medium | High | Cross-device access |
| Shared bills | Medium | Medium | Collaborative splitting |
| Backup/restore | Low | Low | Data safety |
| Payment integration | High | Medium | Simplified payments |

## Infrastructure Requirements

A realistic cloud deployment would require:

- **Containerized services**: Docker + Kubernetes for orchestration
- **CI/CD pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for observability
- **Regional deployment**: Multiple regions for performance and compliance
- **Security**: Regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning

## Cost Projections

Moving from local-only to cloud would introduce costs:

| Component | Small Scale | Medium Scale | Large Scale |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Compute | $100-200/mo | $500-1K/mo | $2K-5K/mo |
| Database | $50-100/mo | $200-500/mo | $1K-3K/mo |
| Storage | $20-50/mo | $100-300/mo | $500-1K/mo |
| Bandwidth | $30-70/mo | $200-400/mo | $1K-2K/mo |
| **Total** | **$200-420/mo** | **$1K-2.2K/mo** | **$4.5K-11K/mo** |

## Conclusion

Scaling Billington beyond its current local-only architecture would require significant architectural changes, most notably the introduction of user accounts and cloud synchronization. While this would add complexity and infrastructure costs, it could be implemented in a way that maintains a strong privacy focus through client-side encryption and data minimization.

The key insight is that scaling isn't just about handling more users—it's about making thoughtful architectural trade-offs that balance privacy, functionality, complexity, and cost. This understanding of system design principles would be crucial for any evolution of the application beyond its current scope.
