issues to fix:

first page:
colors? shit doesn't feel random.

second page:
need ability to remove items that have been added
ensure totals add up to the actual amount (can put 1000 item if the bill was only like 100)
bug: app will die if malicious tip is inserted. fix. could also just remove the typing ability for %

lots of extra space under the avatars, scoot it up

assignment page:
consider the real estate. need pills for assigned items, that have the delete/split with/and custom split functionality.
remove pro tip, or put it somewhere else.
is it worth putting like "each person pays" if there's no items here? their total will be on the next page, and we want them to make it through the workflow

big cards are repetitive? says fully assigned, then assigned 100%, and then a checkmark and fully assigned again.
maybe make the buttons smaller

if they have something selected, but then they toggle bday, they need to be removed from that

assign to X is back, so when X is assigned to item, they can be assigned to it again. rather than the disabled button.
split with X feature, when X is assigned and Y is selected to choose items is gone. 

"Split Evenly" doesn't seem to work properly. it's not being added into their subtotal or something. we can see that the tax doesn't match up.

summary:
calcs work i think

share functionality:
when share is hit, it puts names and their total into a nice text msg format.
could say the items they got, their share of tip and tax, and then the total.
provide a way to add a payment method or something. link their zelle or venmo
who knows

done:
store the last 10 in the shared pref or something
