issues to fix:

bill details in recent bills:
- items won't show? it shows how much i spend, but doesn't list the items properly.
- overflow error on shrink
- fluid animation on the header
- remove the "tax & tip portion" because that's repetitive af

- if you don't have enough items in the thing, say you have a bill of 100 and 1 item in there,
then you can press the unassigned items and it doesn't do what we expect.
- SOLUTIONS? could just enforce the fact that the total must be met or something

- dark mode? causes a plethora of issues throughout the app

- on iphone 15 pro, the custom split button is overflowing.

- the modal for when you don't fully assign, the UNASSIGNED AMOUNT dialog has a kinda ugly UI. the button is messed up too, it doesn't work nor looks good.

- address deprecated methods, and remove comments

- test application thoroughly, potentially just buying the apple license and releasing the app in beta

- collapsable bill total components
- redesign the assignment page, remove the people at the top. 
for item assignment i think it should be click item and have the names pop up instead of names at the top and assign

Option to send SMS invites to contacts

Can still add them to splits manually without Venmo links

or, flip the script. the summary message at the end could be a link for each 
person that needs to pay, to pay the bill-splitter. rather than sending requests.

this could be where the "join bill" feature could shine. having users join the tab, and then they can see everything & jus pay the splitter
or web/app link...text won't work

ask 4 payment info @ start

arguable value:
- could bring a link feature, like you clck the link and it has a unique id.
- tab with deep links shows on frontend webpage...like the text
- Frontend (Vercel) → API (Render: Flask App) → MongoDB Atlas
